Privacy Policy for Roblox Status Notifier
Last updated: [Current Date]
This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the Roblox Status Notifier extension.
Data Collection and Use
The Roblox Status Notifier extension does not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal or user-identifiable data.
The extension's sole function is to anonymously check the public Roblox status API and display that information to you. The only data saved locally on your device via the chrome.storage.local API is the last known status of Roblox's services (e.g., "Operational"). This data is non-personal, is never transmitted, and is essential for the extension's functionality to prevent repeated notifications.
We do not collect web history, user activity, or any other information about you or your browsing habits.
