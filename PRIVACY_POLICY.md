# Privacy Policy for Gemini AI Text Summarizer

**Last Updated:** August 1, 2024

Thank you for using Gemini AI Text Summarizer ("the extension"). This privacy policy explains what information the extension handles and why.

## Information We Handle

The core function of this extension is to summarize text you select on a webpage. To do this, the extension handles the following data:

1.  **Selected Text:** The text content you highlight on a webpage is sent to Google's Gemini API to generate a summary. We do not store this text after the summary is generated and displayed to you. The data is handled transiently for the sole purpose of providing the summarization service.

2.  **Your API Key:** The extension requires you to provide your own Google Gemini API key. This key is stored locally and securely in your browser's synchronized storage (`chrome.storage.sync`), allowing you to use the key across different devices where you are logged into Chrome. Your API key is **only** used to communicate with the Google Gemini API on your behalf and is never transmitted to any other servers.

## How We Use Your Data

-   The selected text is used exclusively to provide the summarization service.
-   Your API key is used exclusively to authenticate your requests with the Google Gemini API.

We do **not** collect, store, or share any other personal information, browsing history, or user activity. The extension's functionality is limited to the text you explicitly select for summarization.

## Third-Party Services

This extension relies on the Google Gemini API to function. When you use the extension, the selected text is processed by Google. We recommend you review their privacy policies to understand how they handle data:

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy with the extension listing.
